About:
	Program for analysis of circuits using Euler 'backward' method or Gear's second order method, user option, attached to the Newton-Raphson method using modified nodal analysis.
	This program was created as a final project for the course of Electrical Circuits 2 given by the Professor Antonio Carlos Moreirao de Queiroz at the Department of Electronic and Computation Engineering of the Polytechnic School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in the first semester of 2007.

HOW TOs:
- compile
	run 'make' or 'make src' on current directory
- compile as debug
	run 'make debug' on current directory
- compile/run profiling
	run 'make prof' on current directory
	results are stored in exec/prof.txt
- compile/run unit tests
	run 'make tests' on current directory
- clean
	run 'make clean' on current directory
- run code
	run './exec/afl' or './exec/afl filename' or 'make run' on current directory
	output files have the same names as input files but finish by '.dat'

WHERE:
- src
	all source files
- include
	all headers files
- exec
	where executable and profiling will be stored
- tests
	all unit tests
- files
	examples of input files with their output
